## Getting Started....
- The website is completely built on `react-js` framework of `javascript` and that's why we need `nodejs` and `npm` installed.
- After the successful installation of `nodejs` and `npm`, clone the repository into your local system using below command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/MugheesMb/developerIdentity.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd developerIdentity

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start's development server
$ npm start
```
# Customize it to make your own portfolio ‚úèÔ∏è

### package.json

Open this file, which is in the main cloned directory, choose any "name" and change "homepage " to `https://<your-github-username>.github.io`. Do not forget the `https://`, otherwise fonts will not load.

  ## Deployment üì¶
  
  When you are done with the setup, you should host your website online.
We highly recommend to read through the [Deploying on Github Pages](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) docs for React.

#### Deploying to Github Pages

This section guides you to deploy your portfolio on Github pages.

- Navigate to `package.json` and enter your domain name instead of `https://developerfolio.js.org/` in `homepage` variable. For example, if you want your site to be `https://<your-username>.github.io/developerIdentity`, add the same to the homepage section of `package.json`.
  
 - Follow through the guide to setup GitHub pages from the official CRA docs [here](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages).
